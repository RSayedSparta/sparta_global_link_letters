Welcome to LINK IT!
This is a crossword game, the main aim of this game is to link the letters that are displayed to create a word. Clicking the letters will enable you to select that letter, a grid of empty boxes will show you what words you have found or blank . Some words are aligned vertically on the grid, the start of the word always starts from the top. You have to clear the stage within the time limit to score maximum points. The logo "Link it" is clickable to the home page. The clear button clears the current input but when the max number of letters are entered the input will be cleared as well. The input will be cleared when a word is found. A leader board is added for each level as well.
